#Bookmark Monitor

##Roadmap

* I want to know when my bookmarks are no longer correct. For example:
 * The page no longer exists (404) - offer to delete.
 * The page has been redirected (301/302) - offer to modify with the new url.
 * The page is temporarily unavailable (500) - offer to monitor until it becomes available again.
 * The page/domain has been flagged as one that contains malware - warn with the option of deleting. 
 * The page title has changes - offer to change the bookmark name.
 * I want to remove duplicate bookmarks. Show me where they are and allow me to choose which one to delete.
* Tags! I want to be able to tag a bookmark in the same way that Delicious does. Tags should be easy to create, modify, remove, group etc.
* I want to be able share my bookmarks, a folder of them, a tag, or maybe a mix.
 * I want to be able to access them anywhere in the world with a simple url like:
     * http://pin.me/123456
     * http://pin.me/danbo/awesome-sock-designs
